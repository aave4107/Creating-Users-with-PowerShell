Active Directory a software built in microsoft that will use to create many users to represent the many employees in a company.

Active Directory is used to manage thousands of users and devices on a Large Scale.

I then create two VMs after in a VM I open up Microsoft Powershell ISE as an admin and then Copy a script given from my instructor in Course Careers and paste onto a new script.
