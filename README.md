# Creating-Users-with-PowerShell
Active Directory a software built in microsoft that will use to create many users to represent the many employees in a company.

Active Directory is used to manage thousands of users and devices on a Large Scale.

I then create two VMs after in a VM I open up Microsoft Powershell ISE as an admin and then Copy a script given from my instructor in Course Careers and paste onto a new script.

I then go to the other VM I created and log in as one of the users I created in the VM I was before to see if the created employee account was up and running

When I logged in I opened up Command Prompt Just to confirm that I was in the employees account.
